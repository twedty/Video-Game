- figured out a bug with how many riddles were being loaded and what the combination was going to be...had 2 separate random functions that collided with one another...working now
- Wanted to put everything in one go as I didn't want to commit work that wasn't actually working as this was being built....but, I added a randomizer to randomize the riddles on each refresh of the screen while also appending the notes in the mainbox and keeping the safe combo in tune with that as well
- created the safe combo as well as responses if the combo is correct or incorrect
- refactored my javascript file and added a reset to the text to be able to look back at the original text without needed to refresh the page

- added image placement inside of the browser---not entirely sure how it will look with other browsers so I will need to test this out before I continue much further
