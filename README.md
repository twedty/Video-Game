# Video-Game

This is a riddle game and once the game is started in the browser you will need to find a certain amount of riddles by looking at the keynotes from the main text. This main text will have 2, 3, or 4 different keynotes telling you which riddles to look for and in what order they will be solved in. To look for the riddles, you can click on any available object/image on the browser to tell you what the riddle is. Sometimes, it's not a riddle though.

Once you have found all the riddles it is now your job to solve them. If you need to, you can use the question mark (hint image) on the top left of the screen for some further assistance. Once you have found the numbers you can click the safe and begin to solve it. And boom! That's the game. 

You don't need to download any other software to use this or start it. All you need is to just start it and you can begin playing.
