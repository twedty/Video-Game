# Video-Game

This is a riddle game and once the game is started in the browser you will need to find a certain amount of riddles by looking at the keynotes from the main text. This main text will have 2, 3, or 4 different keynotes telling you which riddles to look for and in what order they will be solved in. To look for the riddles, you can click on any available object/image on the browser to tell you what the riddle is. Sometimes, it's not a riddle though.

Once you have found all the riddles it is now your job to solve them. If you need to, you can use the question mark (hint image) on the top left of the screen for some further assistance. Once you have found the numbers you can click the safe and begin to solve it. And boom! That's the game.

# DEPENDENCIES

The ONLY dependencies you will need to make sure you have installed is "sass": "^1.77.8" as that is the current version installed for this project. There are no other dependencies required. However, I would suggest doing an npm i before starting this project to make sure everything else in the package-lock is ok.


# START GAME

To start this game you may go into the terminal on whatever coding platform you have choses and type in "start ." and then double click on the index.js file as that is where everything is running from. This project was created before using most of npm and npm start so starting the game is a little bit different than most project AFTER this one. 


## Inspriation
The inspiration I had for this game was to challenge my friends to see who could complete it the fastest as well as who was smarter in figuring out the riddles. I loved showing my family and friends as they were very surprised and excited to check it out which made making it even more fun. Creating the riddles was probably my favorite part of the project because I love writing riddles and stumping people. I do hope whoever plays this enjoys my game!

# HOW TO PLAY

- Your character is movable once you click anywhere on the screen. Once you click somewhere, your character will move there too. The object of the game is to figure out what the riddles are.
- Clicking away from any object will tell you the *code* on how to unlock the safe. You must click ON the objects to figure out where the riddles are located and then figure out how the riddle matches with the code.
- On the right of the screen there is a table with a safe. Match the numbers with the code that was previously stated. You will get two different prompts depending on if you've won or lost.
- You can always refresh the page to try different combinations as every time it is reloaded the code is changed and the location of each riddle is also changed.
- Good luck!
